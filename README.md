# The Context Engine

This project is an experiment in creating a self-updating, AI-driven analysis and reporting system. It uses GitHub Actions and Google's Gemini to create "living" reports that are automatically updated based on new information.

## Overview

The system is designed to:

1.  Fetch new data from external sources.
2.  Use an AI agent to analyze the new data in the context of an existing report.
3.  Generate a complete, updated report.
4.  Publish the report to a static website.

For more details, see the [Project Plan](./specs/ProjectPlan.md).

## Published Reports

The latest reports are available on our [GitHub Pages site](https://jebli.github.io/The-Context-Engine/).
